# Description
## Operation
![flowchart](./assets/atlas-shell-main-v2.png)

## Installation

1. Compile: If you can't figure this out, you probably shouldn't be using a shell. But whatever...

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wpedantic -o $$$hell simple_shell.c

2. **Run**
Bash
./$$$hell

Now you'll see the super cool prompt:

$$$hell :: 
Interactive: ./$$hell
Non Interactive: ./$$hell <command> (Don't forget to replace command with something worthy of my attention


Example
$$$hell :: /bin/ls
$$$hell :: /usr/bin/whoami
$$$hell :: exit
exiting...
```
## Features that'll make you go "YAS Queen":

* **Command Execution:** Runs external commands entered by the user (e.g., `/bin/ls`, `/usr/bin/whoami`).
* **Non-Interactive Mode (Because who needs friends right?): Feed me a single command and I'll execute it, no chit chat, just results. 
* **Interactive Mode (Oh someone's feeling social now huh?): Hang out in my shell and type commands to your heart's content. But don't expect me to be impressed.
* **Built in sass and command support (for only the ones I want): Every prompt is a reminder you're in a shelll that knows it's worth.
* **Environmentally conscious: I CAN display your environment variables using the 'env' command. Because even a sassy shell cares about it's surroundings. 
* **Pathfinder Extraordinaire: I can locate commands like a pro, even if they're hiding.  
* **Argument Handling:** Supports commands with arguments (e.g., `ls -l /tmp`).
* **"exit" (stage left) Command:** When you've had enough of me, just type exit and I'll let you go.
* **Ctrl+D (EOF) Handling:** Exits when you're done playing around.
* **Error Handling:** Catches those pesky `fork` and `execve` fails, letting you know what's up.

## Limitations
* **No Fancy Stuff:** Forget about pipes (`|`), redirection (`>`, `<`), or wildcards (`*`). This shell keeps it simple.
